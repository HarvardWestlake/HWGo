**Introduction**
Welcome to Harvard Westlake Adventure, a mobile augmented reality game that transforms the iconic Harvard Westlake campus into a vibrant, interactive world. Inspired by the mechanics of Pok√©mon Go, this app is designed to engage students, staff, and alumni in a unique exploration of the school's rich heritage. With a target audience primarily comprising current students and alumni, the game offers a novel way to connect with the school community and its history.

**Value/Use**
Harvard Westlake Adventure serves as both an entertaining game and an educational tool. Players learn about the school's history, faculty, and landmarks while engaging in a fun, interactive scavenger hunt. By collecting virtual representations of teachers and notable alumni, users deepen their connection with the school's legacy. This game also promotes physical activity and exploration of the campus, enhancing school spirit and community engagement.

**User Interaction and Experience**
Users will interact with the game via their smartphones, exploring the Harvard Westlake campus to find and collect virtual characters. The game uses GPS and AR technology to overlay the virtual world onto the real campus, creating an immersive experience. Players can collect different faculty members, each with unique attributes and historical facts, by visiting specific campus locations. Social features, such as leaderboards and team challenges, encourage interaction among players. Once a player collects a certain amount of teachers, then they gain access to certain boss battles that can earn them special achievements.


**Competitive Element**
Competition is a key aspect of Harvard Westlake Adventure. Players can form teams based on their school houses or graduation years, competing in weekly challenges to collect rare characters or complete historical quests. Leaderboards display top collectors and teams, fostering a friendly rivalry that promotes continuous engagement with the game.

**Scalability and Expansion**
Harvard Westlake Adventure is designed with scalability in mind. The game can easily be expanded to include new areas of the campus, additional characters, and even virtual representations of significant school events. The flexible architecture allows for easy adaptation to other schools or educational institutions, offering a template for gamified campus exploration. Also, the app's integration with social media will allow for the app to be much easier for players outside of Harvard Westlake to enjoy.

**Accessibility and Inclusivity**
Adhering to the California non-discrimination clause, Harvard Westlake Adventure is designed to be accessible and inclusive for all users. The game includes:
