How to get into battles: If another player is on your friends list if they are within airdrop range on the app it will show up as an opportunity for you to battle them by pressing a button on the screen that says battle. If you press it, the other player will have the opportunity to accept or deny the request to fight. After that, students can choose the teacher they want to battle against the other teacher. 

How the battle is set up: Once the battle is accepted, an arena appears, a bar at the top of the screen appears with “health” and “weapons” that depletes as the battle progresses. You have the ability to throw balls as well, and you can throw a ball to catch the other teacher and they become yours. 

Types of Attacks
Teachers will have attacks corresponding to their department and maybe even specific subject they teach 
Each attack will have a color trail and design corresponding to department (check color palettes doc, idk if the colors below are accurate)
Math: Red and +-x
History: Yellow and old manuscripts + feather pen + textbooks
English: Green and books + punctuation?
Language: Purple + “hello” in a lot of different languages
Or maybe each language has a diff trail with the same color
Science: Blue and science designs (dna, erlenmeyer flask, leaf, planet)
Arts: multicolor and pallet boards + paint brushes + flowers
These just shoot a glowing fireball of a certain color at the other teacher (button = “fire”)

How the battle ends: When the battle ends the arena disappears and the players go back to normal. If you win the battle, you then have the other player's teacher as one of your teachers or you raise level if you already have the teacher.
