# Character Design

## Notes

- Characters should be 2D, because more aesthetic and a lot easier to work with and animate
- Can't look *too* much like the actual people ... 
- Still need to decide what we're doing about their bodies

## Todos

- [ ] add department to image file names
- [x] add teacher name to file names
- [x] pass images through cartoonify program 
- [x] Pass cartoonified images through pixelize program
