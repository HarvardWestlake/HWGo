## Character Generaiton Prompt

<https://beta.pixelvibe.com/>

> Look at the person in the portrait picture I've given you. Type out a prompt that I can input into Midjourney, so that it generates a ** 2D, full body character sprite in the pixel art style of the person I gave you **. Make sure to emphasize the pixel art style, how the full body of the character should be in view, and the background should be white. Make sure to make each of these points short and succint, as minimal words as possible, and separate each of the points with a semicolon. Make sure to include detailed adjectives about things like color, shape, mood, and expression. 


Negative Prompt
