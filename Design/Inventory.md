## Faculty Inventory
The faculty inventory displays all of the faculty collected and yet to be collected by the user. Faculty images are displayed in a grid with each faculty member occupying a square. 
### Owned Faculty
The Owned Faculty page contains only the faculty members currently collected by the user
A pixelated/stylized photo of each collected faculty is contained in a grid square
In the bottom right corner of the grid, there is a number corresponding to the number of collected faculty type
I.e If the user collects three Mr. Yaron’s, the text ‘x3’ appears in the bottom right corner
The background color of each image corresponds to the department
The outer rim of the image corresponds to the rarity of the faculty member
Each faculty member is assigned a rarity level akin to pokemon rarity
The rarity levels are Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Ultra Rare
Common: Bronze
Uncommon: Silver
Rare: Gold
Ultra Rare: Fiery stylized border (some creative liberties can be taken)
### All Faculty
The All Faculty page contains a grid displaying both the owned and unowned faculty 
Owned faculty images have the same appearance as they do in the Owned Faculty Inventory Page
Faculty that haven’t been collected have the same background color and border style, but their image is replaced with a silhouette. 
E.g Animal Crossing’s “Critterpedia”
### Faculty Specific Information
More information about each faculty member can be found by clicking on their icon in the grid
Clicking on an icon opens a pop-up window
Ideally there will be a smooth pop-up animation where the faculty member’s photo enlarges as the rest of the window and text appears. 
In the top left of the window is an enlarged picture of the faculty, to the right and beneath the photo is faculty info 
To the right of the photo is displayed the faculty member’s name, department, and rarity
Beneath the photo is the faculty member’s attacking strength, health, and other features relating to combat/breedability
### UI Features
The inventory will have a simple UI that relies on searching, scrolling, and swiping as the main UI features
At the top of the page will be a search button allowing the user to search through faculty members 
Users can search by name, department, rarity, or any combination of the three attributes. 
After typing in a search feature, clicking enter on the keyboard will create a new search attribute. Typing a new feature and clicking enter again will apply both search attributes
Search attributes appear as rounded rectangles containing the attribute and a small x in the top right corner. Clicking the x removes the attribute. E.g:
The user can view their entire inventory by vertically scrolling 
The user can switch between Owned and All Faculty by swiping left and right
Two small circles beneath the search bar will indicate which page the user is currently on
When switching to another page, one circle will become gray and the other will become colored.
